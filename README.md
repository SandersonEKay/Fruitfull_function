# Fruitfull_function
The following program was written to utilize a fruitful function. A fruitful function is defined as "A function that yields a return value". This program uses the turtle module to visually express the changing output of fruitful functions.  The turtle module is a drawing module imported into the code and manipulated using command codes. The code is based on the recurrences of circles, and allows the user to manipulate the size and the complexity of the picture. Users control choices which are validated by if else statements and stored. Answers given such as "moderate" or "intense" correspond to set numeric values that allow for the function to continue. These values are assigned to variables in pre defined functions that facilitate movement of the turtles.
